# automation-HPC-Api-Multi-disciplinary-meta-automation

A repository for managing APIs, cross-pollination of AI models, extensions, apps & meta-automation of it.

## Overview

This repository provides a structured starting point for a system that handles API management, AI model integration, and other automation tasks. It is designed to be modular and extensible.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code.
  - `src/api/`: Code for interacting with or implementing APIs.
  - `src/models/`: Code related to AI models.
  - `src/extensions/`: Code for extensions to the core functionality.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files.
  - `config/config.json`: The main configuration file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `AGENTS.md`: Instructions for AI agents working on this repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/automation-HPC-Api-Multi-disciplinary-meta-automation.git
    cd automation-HPC-Api-Multi-disciplinary-meta-automation
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  Open `config/config.json` and replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys.
2.  For sensitive data, it is recommended to use environment variables instead of hardcoding values in the configuration file.

## Usage

(Usage instructions will be added as the project develops.)
